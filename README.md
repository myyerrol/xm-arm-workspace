## 1. Introduction

This ros metapackage builds the simple framework for the second generation of xmbot's manipulator, which includes the underlying driver, motion control, motion planning and motion simulation codes.

### 1.1 Hardware Driver

- **xm_arm_robot_hardware:** The xm_arm_robot_hardware package implements hardware interface by using ros_control.
- **xm_arm_hardware_serial_node:** The xm_arm_hardware_serial_node package provides serial communication between ros and embedded.
- **xm_arm_hardware_controller_config:** The xm_arm_hardware_controller_config package provides controller configuration files for controling the arm.

### 1.2 Motion Simulation

- **xm_arm_gazebo:** The xm_arm_gazebo package can launch xmbot in gazebo simulator.
- **xm_arm_gazebo_controller_config:** The xm_arm_gazebo_controller_config package provides controller configuration files for simulating in gazebo.

### 1.3 Motion Control

- **xm_arm_teleop:** The xm_arm_teleop package can control arm by using keyboard.
- **xm_arm_gripper_control:** The xm_arm_gripper_control package can control gripper.
- **xm_arm_trajectory_control:** The xm_arm_trajectory_control package can control joint trajectory.
- **xm_arm_dynamixel_control:** The xm_arm_dynamixel_control package can launch and control dynamixel servos.

### 1.4 Motion Planning

- **xm_arm_moveit_config:** An automatically generated package with all the configuration and launch files for using the xmbot with the MoveIt Motion Planning Framework.
- **xm_arm_moveit_control:** The xm_arm_moveit_control package provides motion planning by using forward or inverse kinematics.

### 1.5 Basic Components

- **xm_arm_msgs:** The xm_arm_msgs package provides messages, services and actions.
- **xm_arm_bringup:** The xm_arm_bringup package provides roslaunch for starting xmbot's arm motion planning and simulation test.
- **xm_arm_description:** The xm_arm_description package provides a complete 3D model of the xmbot for simulation and visualization. The files in this package are parsed and used by a variety of other components.

## 4. Summary

- According to the new mechanical arm software architecture, I rewrited the entire bottom-level driver codes of the xmbot's mechanical arm and add more features, such as motion planning, motion simulation.
- Because of the limited time, I have only finished the simple framework for the second generation of xmbot's manipulator. I haven't fully done some modules in architecture, such as motion planning, obstacle avoidance, v-rep simulation and encapsulation for module.
- For future planning, I will hope that new team members can gradually complete the final mechanical arm software architecture and improve the arm manipulation test better and better. For myself, I will need to improve my theory and programming ability, If there is a chance, then I will continue to do same research on the mechanical arm, until that time, I believe I must do better than now!
